  "summary": "Autonomous iteration loop for OpenCode that drives work from a prompt file.",
  "why": [
    "Maintain momentum on multi-step tasks without repeated manual prompts.",
    "Keep a durable progress log for handoffs and long-running work.",
    "Constrain execution to one useful step per iteration to reduce drift."

  "what": [
    "An OpenCode agent, command, and plugin that execute work in discrete iterations.",
    "Updates the prompt file with status, verification, and next steps after each turn."
  ],
  "useCases": [
    "Break down large migrations into repeatable, verifiable steps.",
    "Run ongoing refactors with clear acceptance criteria and verification checkpoints.",
    "Coordinate long-lived tasks that need consistent progress tracking."
