**Why teams use it**
- Surface runtime errors, routes, and logs directly inside OpenCode.
- Keep MCP config consistent across repos with a repeatable install.
- Reduce manual copy-paste when onboarding new projects.

**What ships with it**
- A Next.js MCP payload file for the dev server.
- A merge script that updates opencode.json or opencode.jsonc.
- A standard MCP server entry that runs `npx -y next-devtools-mcp@latest`.
