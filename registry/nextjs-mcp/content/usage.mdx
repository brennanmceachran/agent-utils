### 1) Set expectations in your agent instructions

Add a short note to your agent instructions (for example AGENTS.md or your OpenCode agent file) so it always uses MCP and docs:

```md
When working on a Next.js project:
- call init at the start of the session
- call nextjs_index before making changes
- use nextjs_docs for Next.js questions
- verify UI changes with browser tools
```

### 2) Start with runtime reality

- Ask for `get_errors` and `get_routes` before touching code.
- Use `get_page_metadata` when you are unsure what a route renders.

### 3) Use the browser for anything visual

- Ask for a screenshot and console errors after UI changes.
- When bugs only show in the browser, use Playwright to reproduce.
- Example: "Open /, take a screenshot, and suggest UI improvements."

### 4) Keep docs and upgrades close

- When you hit a Next.js API question, ask the agent to query official docs.
- Use the upgrade and cache component helpers when you are migrating.

### 5) Keep the loop tight

After each fix, re-check errors and verify the page again.
