**What this gives you**
- Hooks OpenCode into the Next.js dev server MCP endpoint (`/_next/mcp`).
- Lets you read errors, logs, and routes without leaving the terminal.
- Adds `next-devtools-mcp` to opencode.json/jsonc with a repeatable merge.

**Try it**
1. Install the files from this registry.
2. Merge the MCP payload:

```bash
node .opencode/bin/merge-mcp.mjs
```

3. Start your dev server and query MCP tools (get_errors, get_logs, get_routes).
