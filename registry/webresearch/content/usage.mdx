### 1) Frame the decision
State what you are trying to decide or ship. Put that in the `reason` field so the summary stays focused. The tool runs codex web_search_request under the hood.

### 2) Write the queries
Use multiple queries separated by new lines or semicolons to cover edge cases:

```yaml
query: "Next.js MCP guide; next-devtools-mcp repo; Next.js 16 MCP endpoint"
```

### 3) Add context and depth
Provide versions, constraints, or must-read sources:

```yaml
additional_context: "We are on Next.js 16.0.0; need official docs and repo links"
quality: deep
```

### 4) Capture output with citations
Paste the summary and sources into your design notes or PR description. If sources conflict, re-run with a narrower follow-up query.
