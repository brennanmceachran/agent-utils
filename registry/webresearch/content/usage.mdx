### 1) Use it when you need freshness or unfamiliar context

- New framework features, breaking changes, or updated docs.
- Libraries you have not touched in a while.
- Claims in blog posts that need verification.

### 2) Ask for decision-ready output

- "Summarize, list caveats, and cite sources."
- "Call out assumptions and conflicting sources."
- "Give me a recommendation with tradeoffs."

### 3) Give constraints up front

- Versions, environments, and what counts as a trusted source.
- The exact decision you need to make.

### 4) Fuse the results back into your work

- Pull key quotes or links into your PRD or PR.
- Re-run with a narrower prompt if the sources disagree.

### 5) Keep it conversational

You can just say: "Research this if you are not sure" and the tool will kick in.
