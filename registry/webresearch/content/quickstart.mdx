**What this gives you**

- A web research tool that delegates to Codex CLI search and returns a summary, caveats, and sources.
- Works even when OpenCode web search is feature-flagged off.
- Lets you ask for research in plain language; no URLs required.

**Quickstart**

1. Install the tool (requires `codex` on your PATH).
2. Ask your agent:

- "If you do not know X, research it and cite sources."
- "Research the latest Next.js cache components docs and summarize."

3. If you need more depth, say "do a deep research pass" or "use deep web research."
